# Project-X

NOTE THAT some files are large so github is not accepting an upload, I will update this frequnetly to fix the problem with the files.

Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, I am excited to share with you a demo for a game that I created four years ago when I was just starting out with Unity and programming in general. This project was a significant milestone for me as it was my first time building a game from scratch, and it helped me discover how interesting game development and programming could be.

Creating this game all by myself during my last year of high school for a competition was a challenging yet rewarding experience for me. It required me to learn the basics of Unity, C# programming, and game design principles, and I had to overcome many obstacles along the way. However, the process of seeing my ideas come to life on the screen was incredibly satisfying and made all the effort worthwhile, that and of course ranking 4th in the competiton. Luckily I am now an certified Associate Game developer by unity. 

While this demo represents my early work, I am still proud of what I accomplished and am excited to share it with others who may be starting their journey into game development and programming. I hope that by sharing this project, I can inspire others to pursue their passions and discover the same joy and fulfillment that I have found in creating games.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page and check out my demo. I look forward to hearing your feedback and answering any questions you may have.


The game is a 3D horror shooter game called "Project 4X" the story is as follows:

"Project 4X was supposed to be one of the most highly effecient parasite-based cures. It was meant to enchance the immune system of the body, but instead, the parasite mutated and started feeding on the brain causing hallucinations, loss of vision and aggression, in extreme cases.. death. Me and my wife Dr. Naomi along with other scientists were responsible of cleaning the aftermath of the project but the mutated parasite escaped it's containtment field and suddenly ....
EVERYTHING CHANGED !"
